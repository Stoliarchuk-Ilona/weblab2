              <p>Chances are, you've found this page for good reason: You've just picked up a Tarot deck, perhaps your first. You've spent some time flipping and familiarizing, and are ready to put them to use. This is an exciting undertaking—insight into your past, present, and even factors influencing your future can all be found in the cards.</p>
              <p>You may be a bit confused or overwhelmed. There are lots of cards to master (we'll get to that in a moment), and if you've read the booklet that came in the company of your deck, you're likely feeling only slightly closer to becoming the intuitive that you know you are.</p>
              <p>But, with Tarot, it's best to trade fear for trust. By the time you're done here, you'll feel much more comfortable shuffling, placing, and reading your cards.</p>
